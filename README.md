# Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience

Julia implementation of the simulations in the book _Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience_ in the form of Jupyter Notebooks

## Requirements

The notebooks require Julia 1.0, Jupyter and IJulia to run. Follow the instructions in [this website](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)

## Running

To open a notebook, simply run
